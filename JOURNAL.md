# Highway-DrawingMachine

day 1 5/20/25 6:51 EST Starting to develop an idea behind initial project 

Created basic java code to take in simple drawings and export out an image of the reflected drawing as well as a basic gcode file reflecting the creation of the final project. 

next step is looking into a motor control based system to create the linear movement as well as creating a basic prototype in SolidWorks of the chasis and base

my goals for a final project 

being able to upload a PNG file and running the machine to draw the object 

additional goals:
  "Tool" changing
    creating colored images by swapping pen colors as well as swapping out old/dead pens
  picture recognition
    being able to take a picture of an object by a camera near the device that will recgonize any shapes/pictures and will draw them
